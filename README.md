Final Project
How do I approach designing software?
I begin by defining my project's goals and requirements. Planned the structure and functionality of my software. Working on the project improved my skills in user interface design, 3D modeling, and understanding visual representations.
I followed a process involving brainstorming, sketching, and wireframing. This design approach can be applied to future projects for better software.

How do I approach developing programs?
I started with a clear problem statement. Then I planned my program's architecture, write code incrementally, and test rigorously to ensure proper implimentation. For the 3D scene, I learned about graphics programming, shader development, and optimization techniques.
Iteration was crucial for refining the 3D scene, improving performance, and fixing bugs early in the creation.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer science provides problem-solving skills, logical thinking, and programming expertise to reach various goals. hese skills can enhance my educational path by enabling me to create interactive simulations and educational visualizations.
Career prospects improve thanks to the widespread use of computational graphics in industries such as video game design and data visualization.
